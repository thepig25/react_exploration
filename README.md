=================


Starting to have some fun with react. 

Pros and Cons so far
---------------------
### Pros
-   Server Side JS
-   Easy to pick up.
-   Great Documentation. 
-   Unit Testing
-   Creat components 

### Cons

- Mixing Presentation Logic (Always had an issue with this). Maybe just me and not a con. 
- Lack of Two way binding [React Two Way Binding](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/two-way-binding-helpers.html).
- Inline Styling?? [React Inline Styling](http://facebook.github.io/react/tips/inline-styles.html).
- Need for backbone to define model. Might creat a lot of code for a simple task
